			The game is played between two teams. Each team consists of eleven played. Two umpires conduct the game. Cricket is played
			on a round playground. A smooth and grassy field is needed. A pitch of 22 yards is made at the center of the field. Two
			specially made wooden balls, two sets of stumps and some pads are required for the game. At the beginning of the game
			tossing is necessary to decide the attackers and the attacked. The bawlers and the fielders are the attackers. The attacked
			try to defend it first and then score runs. If the hitted ball touches the boundary lines, four runs are scored. If it
			this over the boundary line, six runs are scored. The batsman may be out in many ways. When all the batsman of the attacked
			are out, the innings ends. Then the second innings starts after a few minutes. The team collecting more runs is declared
			winner.</div>
