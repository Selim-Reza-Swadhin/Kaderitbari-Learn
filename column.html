			<h2>Country's maritime territory in the Bay of Bengal is roughly equal to the size of its land area</h2>

			<p>Country's maritime territory in the Bay of Bengal is roughly equal to the size of its land area.[12]Bangladesh is the
				world's eighth most populous country. Dhaka is its capital and largest city, followed by Chittagong, which has the country's
				largest port. Bangladesh forms the largest and easternmost part of the Bengal region.[13] Bangladeshis include people
				from a range of ethnic groups and religions. Bengalis, who speak the official Bengali language, make up 98% of the population.[2][3]The
				politically dominant Bengali Muslims make the nation the world's third largest Muslim-majority country. Most of Bangladesh
				is covered by the Bengal delta, the largest delta on Earth. The country has 700 rivers and 8,046 km (5,000 miles) of
				inland waterways. Highlands with evergreen forests are found in the northeastern and southeastern regions of the country.
				Bangladesh has many islands and a coral reef. The longest unbroken sea beach, Cox's Bazar Beach is located here. It is
				home to the Sundarbans, the largest mangrove forest in the world. The country's biodiversity includes a vast array of
				plant and wildlife, including endangered Bengal tigers, the national animal. The Greeks and Romans identified the region
				as Gangaridai, a powerful kingdom of the historical subcontinent, in the 3rd century BCE. Archaeological research has
				unearthed several ancient cities in Bangladesh, which enjoyed international trade links for millennia.[14] The Bengal
				Sultanate and Mughal Bengal transformed the region into a cosmopolitan Islamic imperial power between the 14th and 18th
				centuries. The region was home to many principalities that made use of their inland naval prowess.[15][16] It was also
				a notable center of the global muslin and silk trade. As part of British India, the region was influenced by the Bengali
				renaissance and played an important role in anti-colonial movements. The Partition of British India made East Bengal
				a part of the Dominion of Pakistan; and renamed it as East Pakistan. The region witnessed the Bengali Language Movement
				in 1952 and the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971.[17] After independence was achieved, a parliamentary republic was
				established. A presidential government was in place between 1975 and 1990, followed by a return to parliamentary democracy.
				The country continues to face challenges in the areas of poverty, education, healthcare and corruption. Bangladesh is
				a middle power and a developing nation. Listed as one of the Next Eleven, its economy ranks 46th in terms of nominal
				gross domestic product (GDP) and 29th in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP). It is one of the largest textile exportersin
				the world. Its major trading partners are the European Union, the United States, China, India, Japan, Malaysia and Singapore.
				With its strategically vital location between Southern, Eastern and Southeast Asia, Bangladesh is an important promoter
				of regional connectivity and cooperation. It is a founding member of SAARC, BIMSTEC, the Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar
				Forum for Regional Cooperation and the Bangladesh Bhutan India Nepal Initiative. It is also a member of the Commonwealth
				of Nations, the Developing 8 Countries, the OIC, the Non Aligned Movement, the Group of 77 and the World Trade Organization.
				Bangladesh is one of the largest contributors to United Nations peacekeeping forces.</p>
